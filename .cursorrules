# Cursor Rules for MISESAPO Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project follows **MDCS (Misesapo Deductive Classification System)** as its core development philosophy.

**Core Philosophy**: "Not a system that never fails, but a system that can fail safely"

## 📐 MDCS Core Principles

### 1. Syllogism (Ensuring Accuracy of Premises)
- Verify the accuracy of premises
- Ensure consistency across classification methods
- **Logic Structure**: If element A belongs to group B (A ∈ B) and element A belongs to group C (A ∈ C), then group B and group C represent the same conceptual group (B ≡ C)

### 2. Deduction (Expansion from Premises to Conclusions)
- Derive conclusions from premises
- Expand logically from base systems to individual systems

### 3. Expanding Philosophy (Deductive Expansion)
- Start from the base and gradually expand
- Use deductive expansion, not inductive convergence

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 3-Layer Classification

1. **Customer Interface System**: Public site + User management
2. **Business Operations System**: Sales tools + Staff utility tools
3. **Management & Control System**: Internal management system

### Development Phases

1. Phase 1: Infrastructure (Auth, Database, API)
2. Phase 2: Business Operations (Staff tools)
3. Phase 3: Business Operations (Sales tools)
4. Phase 4: Customer Interface
5. Phase 5: Management & Control

## 🔑 Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **Ensure Premises (Syllogism)**
   - Verify that the same element belongs to the same group across all classification methods
   - Ensure consistency between classification methods

2. **Deductive Expansion (Deduction)**
   - Expand logically from base systems
   - Build step by step based on premises

3. **Expanding Philosophy (Deductive Expansion)**
   - Expand from small base to large system step by step
   - Use deductive expansion, not inductive convergence

4. **"System that can fail safely"**
   - Limit the impact of failures
   - Make recovery from failures easy

## 💡 Important Notes

- Always maintain logical consistency
- Build step by step from the base
- Use deductive expansion, not inductive convergence
- Design for failure recovery, not failure prevention
